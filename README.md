# Animated ToDo
This is a project I decided to take to culminate my few past experiences with React Native and also to attempt the framwork properly.

## Ingredients
React Native: based on ReactJS but able to use native platform capabilities
Expo: Toolset for both building and delivering React Native apps
React Navigation: Screen routing and navigation
NativeBase: Themeable component library module
React Native Reanimated: Animation module
React Native SVG: SVG drawing module
Moti: Helper module for reanimated
